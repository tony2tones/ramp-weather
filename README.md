# RampWeather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.8.
The weather application uses [Material Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/).  

In this project, seeing that I needed to have a 7 day forecast including today. I have used the following 
[api](https://openweathermap.org/forecast16_) that provides a forecast for the next 16 days.

## Setup and how to get your API key

Weather data is coming from [Open weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), 
which requires registration and you will need to add your OpenWeatherAPI key as seen in the services file.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run test` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## runing unit tests with Jest

Unit tests can be run using the following command line.

    npm run test

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npx jest` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).
